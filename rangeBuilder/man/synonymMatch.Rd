\title{Match synonyms to accepted names}
\usage{
synonymMatch(x, db, yearCutoff = NULL, searchSynonyms = TRUE,
  fuzzyDist = 2, advancedSearch = FALSE, returnMultiple = FALSE,
  progressBar = TRUE, nthreads = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a character vector of Genus_species_subspecies (can be multiple)}

\item{db}{squamates, birds, mammals or amphibians}

\item{yearCutoff}{year for oldest considered synonyms, please treat as experimental.}

\item{searchSynonyms}{if FALSE, strict and fuzzy matching is applied only
to the list of accepted names}

\item{fuzzyDist}{for fuzzy searching, the maximum string distance allowed
for a match}

\item{advancedSearch}{logical, should advanced searching be used, see
Details.}

\item{returnMultiple}{if \code{FALSE}, \code{NA} is returned if no match
found or if multiple matches found. if \code{TRUE}, then multiple hits are
returned.}

\item{progressBar}{if \code{FALSE}, progress bar will be suppressed.}

\item{nthreads}{number of threads to use for parallelization of the
function.}
}
\value{
a vector of matches, \code{NA} if the species name could not be
unambiguously matched to a single accepted name. If \code{returnMultiple =
TRUE}, then \code{NA} is only returned when the taxon name is not matched at
all in the database.
}
\description{
Performs strict and fuzzy matching to return the accepted species name
}
\details{
The order of the procedure applied here is as follows:\cr
	\cr First Pass: \cr
	\itemize{
	\item Strict matching against accepted names, \cr
	\item fuzzy matching against accepted names, \cr
	\item strict matching against synonyms,\cr 
	\item fuzzy matching against synonyms,\cr\cr
	}
	Second Pass:
	\itemize{
	\item Same as first pass, but ignoring subspecies\cr
	}
	Advanced Search: \cr
	\itemize{
	\item Same as first pass, but with consideration of alternate latin suffixes and 
	all genus/species combinations.
	}
	\cr

	The squamate database is a local copy of the Reptile Database
	(\url{http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/}), which will be updated
	periodically. The list of accepted names within this R package are those
	that are listed as such on the website.

	The bird database is the BirdLife Taxonomic Checklist as downloaded
	from \url{http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/info/taxonomy}.

	The mammal database is Wilson and Reeder's Mammal Species of the World, 3rd
	edition, downloaded from
	\url{http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/biology/resources/msw3/},
	and supplemented with searches of the ITIS database with the 
	\code{taxize} R package.

	The amphibian database is a local copy of the AmphibiaWeb taxonomy
	(\url{amphibiaweb.org/taxonomy/index.html}), which will be updated
	periodically.

	To see when these datasets were last updated for this R package, run
	\code{\link{downloadDates}}.

# simple misspelling
synonymMatch('Crotalus_atrix', db = 'squamates')

# synonym
synonymMatch('Pipistrellus_macrotis', db = 'mammals')

#synonym with slight misspelling
synonymMatch('Tangara_pulchirrima', db = 'birds')

#no match, but return multiple
synonymMatch('Masticophis_flagellum', db = 'squamates', returnMultiple = TRUE)
